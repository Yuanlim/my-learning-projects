        Before I introduce myself, let me share with you a story. A story about
        me, and how great I am. But first, I think it would be appropriate to
        introduce myself. I am going to do this soon. So, it all started, in a
        smelly house, north of Wellington, south of Arizona and east of where
        you are sitting right now. It was a dark night, with no birds nor
        chickens, and it was raining a silent rain. There were too many stars to
        count, and not enough clouds to cover them. I like chickens. But anyway,
        what was I doing in this smelly house?
