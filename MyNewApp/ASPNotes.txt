DbContext = your app’s connection to the DB + the list of tables it uses.

DbSet<T> = a table (e.g., DbSet<Game> = Games table).

Entity class (Game, Genre) = the table’s columns.

OnModelCreating = where you define table rules: primary keys, foreign keys (relations), column sizes, etc.

HasData = seed initial rows.

Migration = EF generates a SQL change script for your table changes.

DbContextOptions = connection settings (provider + connection string).

Scoped = one DbContext per web request.

// Seeding
dotnet ef migrations add SeedGenres --output-dir Data\Migrations
